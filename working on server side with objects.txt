////working on server side with objects///
task to take object and store it in database usually as Multipart file
to do this we have to marshall ( map ) object in format that database accepts (like rows and columns, tables )

Object relational mapping (ORM) 

Tool is a Framework - JAVA Persistance API (JPA)
Idea : annotate object so telling how to store them in DB

Create java class with JPA annotaions for instances of this class

@Entity // declaration that this is persistant object

public class Video {

@Id  // declaration of uniqness for this member that is necessary for database search
private long video_number;

private String name_of_video;


}
@GeneratedValue (strategy=GenerationTyp.Auto) // Expecting JPA to act and insert ID

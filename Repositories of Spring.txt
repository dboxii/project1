Store Find Retrieve -- Tasks with @Entity ie Persistance Object in DB
For this for JPA in Spring REPOSITORY should be created --> Interface

@Repository
public interface VideoRepo extend CRUDREPOSITORY<Video, long>{
//Crud - create, read, update, delete objects		 ^	
							  \unique id

//search must be possible to perform on diff variable not only by unque id
public List<Video> findByName(String name);//findBy -is Spring prefix and Name is name of Variable of the Video class

public List<Video> findByNameAndCategory(String name, String category)

}

/////////////
SQL injection attack = Do NOt MIX parameters and logic ie. do not let direct insertion request into Sql request.

Look in detail on example 5 
Engaging repo in Application class
@EnableJpaRepositories(basePackageClasses = VideoRepository.class)

Adding @BEan for Autowired members not required

 findByName(String title);- Spring auto create SQL request to DB


//////Spring Data Rest//// Automatic routing client GET POST PUT DELETE to DB located eg at "/video"

To use it in Repository Interface we add on top
@RepositoryRestResourse (collectionResourseRelation "videos";
path="video")

Second is necessary to establish in Application java a configuration
@Import({RepositoryRestMVCConfiguration})


@EnableJPARepositories


/////Example 6 Spring DATA Rest API walktru//////
Implementation of methods on videos was taken by VideoRepository.class
so Controller clas file was eliminated from package

DATA MARSHALLING  - extracting params to object via Object Mapping.

DISPATCHER service =>servlet => its 2nd layer routing (like web.xml) that routs to Controller
So its routs certain parameters right to methods inside certain servlets
(maps request path to particular method) looks if http req params fits to method argums

registering Controller - java object to handle request via simple methods like
update Balance ();
////SPRING CONTROLLERS for DISPATCH//////////


SIMPLE JAVA object

@Controller
public class ContactsCtrl{

@RequestMapping("/contacts")


public Contacts getContacts(){
//do smt to retrieve contacts
Contacts c=...;
return c;

}

@RequestMapping("/friends") //here http request will be routed if it will contains path /friends.
public Contacts friends(){

}

}
/////PARAMETER Annotations in SPRING////
Example: User want to find smd via first letters on Object Contacts

@Controller
public class ContactsCtrl{

@RequestMapping ("/search")
public Contacts search{
@RequstParam("search")	string searchstring;

//below flag is passed as string SO DispatcherService will convert it to type Int for you
@RequstParam("flag") 	int searchflag;// search in first or last name

}

/////Path Variable Annotations in SPRING////

//lets make response that return all contacts beginining with A on request: /search/a

it will look nice and clean

So we must be able to translate request path not params in it
it will look like this

@RequestMapping ("search/{str}") //so anyting in requst path will be routed here
Then here we telling dispatcher what to do with it {str}
@PathVar("str") string searchstring;


/////BODY Annotations in SPRING////

CAN extract entire body(smt more complex then string like java object) and path them in as method parameters


Lets say there is object Search

public class Search{
private String firstname 	;
private String lastname;

//getters and setters
//regular expression match method and son on

}

So in spring search param could be object

@RequestMapping ("/search")
Search s;

To tell dispatcher that http request params are instanses of object Search :
@RequestBody Search s;
